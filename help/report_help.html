<h3>Current Records</h3>
<p>These reports provide the top three record values for each day of the year based
on the current status of the ACIS database. Most station's period of record runs
through the previous day (and is noted at the top of each report). The accompanying
graph shows the range between the first and third daily record values. For precipitation, 
"traces" display the same as zero values in the graph (but the distinction is made in the
table).

<p>The "Changes from latest archive version" selection, gives the changes to the 
ThreadEx records (only top one for each day) that have occurred since the latest annual 
archive run was produced. Values 
highlighted in <span style="color:red;">red</span> indicate new records since the
archive version and years highlighted in <span style="color:red;">red</span> indicate records 
that tied those in the archive version.

<h3>Latest Archive Version of Records</h3>
<p>ThreadEx has an annual archive run shortly after the end of each year. Records from 
this run are distributed to the National Weather Service for
first review and then operational use. Reports from the latest annual archive version 
of ThreadEx are available through these choices. Graphs are also provided as described 
above.

<p>A report listing changes from the previous 
annual archive run is also available. Values listed in this latter report include 
records that were broken during that year, as well as, changes to record values due to 
corrections or addition/subtraction of data to/from the station's ThreadEx record. Values 
highlighted in <span style="color:red;">red</span> indicate new records from the previous 
version and years highlighted in <span style="color:red;">red</span> indicate records 
that were tied in a more recent year.

<h3>Data Coverage</h3>
